deprecations:
  - |
    The `disappoint` functionality that could be used to automatically
    disappoint customers is deprecated in this version of the product and will
    be removed in the next version.
    To disappoint customers in the future, use either the `crash_reliably`
    or the `condescending_unicorn` functionality.
